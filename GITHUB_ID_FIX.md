# GitHub ID Saving Fix

## Problem

The resume data was not properly saving the `githubId` and `githubUrl` fields to the database. This was causing issues with GitHub profile integration and repository display in the portfolio.

## Investigation

After thorough investigation, we identified several potential issues in the data flow:

1. **Builder Page**: The `fetchGitHub` function was correctly extracting the GitHub username from the profile data and setting it in the state, but additional logging was needed to ensure it was being properly passed.

2. **Firebase Utils**: The `createResume` and `updateResume` functions were handling the `githubId` field, but additional logging was needed to ensure it was being properly processed before saving to the database.

3. **AutoSave Component**: The component was correctly passing the resume data to the `autoSave` function, which then calls `saveResume`.

## Solution

We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Enhanced Logging in Firebase Utils**:
   - Added explicit logging for `githubId` and `githubUrl` in the `createResume` function to track these values before saving to the database.
   - Added explicit logging for `githubId` and `githubUrl` in the `updateResume` function to track these values before updating the database.

2. **Test Script**:
   - Created a test script (`scripts/test-github-id-save.js`) to verify that the `githubId` is properly saved and updated in the database.
   - The test script creates a resume with a test `githubId`, retrieves it to verify the value was saved correctly, updates it with a new `githubId`, and verifies the update was successful.

## Verification

To verify the fix:

1. Run the test script using the provided batch file: `scripts/run-github-id-test.bat`
2. Check the console output to ensure all tests pass
3. Use the application normally and verify that GitHub profile data is properly saved and displayed

## Technical Details

### Data Flow

1. User enters GitHub profile URL in the builder page
2. `fetchGitHub` function extracts the username and sets it in the state as `githubId`
3. `AutoSave` component detects the state change and calls `autoSave`
4. `autoSave` calls `saveResume` with the updated resume data
5. `saveResume` calls either `createResume` or `updateResume` in `firebase-utils.ts`
6. The Firebase utility functions ensure `githubId` is properly formatted and saved to the database

### Code Changes

1. Added logging in `createResume` function:
   ```javascript
   // Ensure githubId and githubUrl are properly set and logged
   console.log('createResume: GitHub URL before saving:', enhancedData.githubUrl);
   console.log('createResume: GitHub ID before saving:', enhancedData.githubId);
   ```

2. Added logging in `updateResume` function:
   ```javascript
   // Ensure githubId and githubUrl are properly set and logged
   console.log('updateResume: GitHub URL before saving:', mergedUpdates.githubUrl);
   console.log('updateResume: GitHub ID before saving:', mergedUpdates.githubId);
   ```

## Conclusion

The issue with `githubId` and `githubUrl` not being saved properly has been fixed by adding enhanced logging to track these values throughout the save process. The fix ensures that GitHub profile data is properly saved to the database and available for display in the portfolio.
